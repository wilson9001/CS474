Possible models:
	encoder-decoder structures, compare loss during normal operation to known anomalies
	Recurrent neural nets, using LSTM's or GRU's
	Simpler feed-forward deep networks

Be sure to use metrics which can accurately measure predictive power of a model in time-series data

Use set 2 to help speed up process of dividing data
